The navigation bar is featured on all four pages, with the Quiz name "Wanderlust WIz" on the left corner with the logo and links to other pages of the website on the right. The fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo, Home page, Quiz page, About us and page and is identical on each page to allow for easy navigation.

It includes options such as "Home," "Quizzes," "Categories," "Leaderboards," "Profile," and more, ensuring that users can access their desired content with just a click.

* Mobile-Friendly Navigation: On smaller screens, such as smartphones, the navbar may transform into a collapsible menu, accessible via a hamburger icon. This streamlined mobile navigation ensures a clutter-free and user-friendly experience on mobile devices.

# Technologies

2. CSS - To style and design user friendly pages 
3. Balsamiq - To create a wireframe
   
# Testing

I conducted comprehensive testing of the website across various web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge. Additionally, I ensured compatibility with mobile devices, specifically testing on a Iphone XR & PRO.

I verified the site's responsiveness across different screen sizes using the developer tools' device toolbar.

# Bugs
* I enhanced text readability on the main page by increasing the opacity. This was particularly important as it overlaid a background image.

* The properties on the home page were initially unreadable due to an issue with the JavaScript script that was included unnecessarily.

* To prevent users from clicking multiple times on the same button, I disabled the option buttons upon clicking and set their attributes to 'disabled=true.

* Upon reaching the time limit, I cleared the content on the page.

* I applied an HTML formatter to improve code readability and structure.

* I mistakenly duplicated the same CSS ID twice, which is against the rule that IDs must be unique.

* In the JavaScript code, I corrected some variables that had started with uppercase letters.

* To improve the layout, I relocated the questions to the bottom of the page.

# Validator testing

The website operates at peak efficiency, boasting a user-friendly and intuitive interface. Users can effortlessly navigate and accomplish their objectives without encountering any obstacles.
